# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Godspeed Crawler

> 🚀 Internship POC Submission by **Aditya Deshmukh**
> B.Tech, IIT Kanpur | [GitHub](https://github.com/adityadeshmukh23)

## 🎯 Objective

The **Godspeed Crawler** is a robust, event-driven content ingestion engine built for developers, researchers, and AI systems. It systematically pulls structured content from GitHub repositories (public or private) and web URLs, then stores this content locally in a format suitable for indexing, offline retrieval, and use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

The crawler minimizes redundant processing using commit hashes and content hashing strategies, empowering modern workflows like auto-updating documentation, changelog monitors, and AI data ingestion.

## ✅ Features Implemented in POC

| Feature                       | Description                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔁 GitHub Repository Sync     | Efficient ingestion using GitHub API and commit diff logic               |
| 🗂 Folder Structure Mirroring | Mirrors the GitHub repo layout exactly into local folders                |
| 📄 Markdown with Metadata     | All content saved in `.md` with YAML frontmatter: source URL, timestamps |
| 🧠 SHA/Commit-based Sync      | Updates only new/modified files, reducing I/O and processing load        |
| 🔐 Secure Token Handling      | `.env` with GitHub token; ignored via `.gitignore` to prevent leaks      |

## 🧠 Technical Design

### 🧱 Architectural Choices

* **Node.js + Godspeed Framework**: Enables event-driven scalability
* **Modular Design**: Easily extensible for new sources like Twitter or Notion
* **Metadata-First**: Frontmatter YAML is used for traceability, data lineage, and future AI use

### 🔍 Sync Strategy

* **GitHub Sync**:

  * Fetch file tree from repo using GitHub REST API
  * Compare with locally stored commit hash or generate SHA-256
  * Pull only changed files and update their metadata

* **Content File Structure**:

```bash
data/
└── github/
    └── owner/
        └── repo/
            ├── README.md
            └── docs/
                └── guide.md
```

* Each file contains:

```yaml
---
source_url: https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/docs/guide.md
last_updated: 2025-06-21T18:00:00Z
commit_hash: 90b9f3bb7d64b...
---
```

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* `axios`: GitHub API integration
* `fs-extra`: file read/write with recursive folder creation
* `dotenv`: secure token handling
* `yaml`: metadata handling

## 🧭 Vision – Future Scope & Strategic Potential

This project is not just a utility. It is a **platform** for intelligent, scalable, and modular content operations.

### 🌐 Web Content Ingestion (Next Step)

* Support for RSS feeds, XML sitemaps, and direct DOM scraping
* Tools: `playwright`, `cheerio`, `rss-parser`

### 🧠 RAG-Ready Design

* Files preprocessed for embedding, retrieval, or summarization
* Pluggable with LangChain, Haystack, or vector DBs

### 🧰 Developer CLI & API

* CLI: `npx godspeed-crawl` with custom config
* REST API for sync on demand (external trigger/webhook-ready)

### ⏱️ Smart Scheduling & Events

* Cron-based automation (`godspeed-cron`)
* GitHub webhook support for instant diff-based updates

### 🧪 File Diffing & Version Control

* Deep diffing using content hashing (SHA-256)
* Enable version rollback and delta inspection

### 🧑‍💻 Dashboard: Godspeed Studio Integration

* UI panel to view:

  * File sync status
  * Logs (success/failed/skipped)
  * Source health & history

### 🔌 Plugin Architecture

* Sources:

  * 🧵 Twitter/X Threads
  * 🧾 PDF scraping via `pdf-parse`
  * 🧠 Notion, Obsidian Vaults
  * 🧬 Wikipedia, research portals

### 🔐 Security-First

* Enforce secret scanning rules
* Token scoping (read-only)
* Optional: Vault-based secure key retrieval

### 🔎 Search + Index Layer

* Local semantic search interface
* Metadata query filter for advanced inspection

## 🙋🏻‍♂️ Thought Process & Ownership

As a passionate backend and data enthusiast, I approached this project with the mindset of solving a **real-world developer problem**: intelligent, low-overhead content sync. Every design decision—from metadata schema to SHA-based syncing—was made to align with automation-first workflows and future RAG integration.

The experience taught me:

* How to architect a modular system
* Practical application of GitHub APIs
* How to handle secure auth in Node
* Versioning + diffing techniques using hash-based file tracking

This is **not just a script**—it’s a scalable system ready for industry deployment with the right extensions.

> 🔚 **Final Note**: The POC lays a strong foundation. With a few key features (cron, RSS, Studio UI), it can evolve into a flagship Godspeed-native backend crawler module.
