# 🚀 Godspeed Crawler – POC Submission

> **Proof of Concept** for the Godspeed Remote Internship Program  
> Developed by: [Aditya Deshmukh](https://github.com/adityadeshmukh23) | B.Tech Student, IIT Kanpur

## 📌 Overview

**Godspeed Crawler** is a content ingestion system that intelligently extracts content from GitHub repositories and web URLs and stores them in structured local folders. The system ensures efficiency by syncing only new or modified content using commit hashes, content hashing, or timestamps.

This project demonstrates:
- 🔧 Real-world backend automation
- 🧠 Thoughtful design and modular development
- ⚡ Industry-relevant tooling and workflow

## 🧠 Project Highlights

| Feature                          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔁 **GitHub Sync**               | Extracts latest repo content using GitHub API + commit hash diff            |
| 🧱 **Folder Mirroring**          | Local folder structure mirrors GitHub repository layout                     |
| 🗃️ **YAML Metadata**            | Each `.md` file contains metadata (source, commit hash, update timestamp)  |
| 📁 **Selective Writes**          | Writes only new/modified content using SHA/commit-based comparison          |
| 🔐 **Secure Auth**               | Uses GitHub Personal Access Token via `.env` (not committed)                |

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – core engine  
- **Godspeed Framework** – modular event-driven scaffold  
- **Axios** – for fetching GitHub API and URLs  
- **fs-extra** – smart file and folder handling  
- **dotenv** – secure API key and config storage  
- **yaml** – for metadata formatting

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

bash
# Step 1: Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/adityadeshmukh23/godspeed-crawler-poc.git
cd godspeed-crawler-poc

# Step 2: Install dependencies
npm install

# Step 3: Set your GitHub token in a .env file
touch .env

Add this line to .env (no spaces):
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here

# Step 4: Run the crawler
node index.js

## 🧭 Future Scope – Vision Beyond the POC

This project is designed with extensibility and real-world adoption in mind. Below are some high-impact directions for future development:

---

### 🌐 1. Web Content Ingestion via RSS, Sitemaps & Scraping
- Extend crawler to ingest structured content from blogs, news portals, and documentation sites.
- Leverage RSS feeds, XML sitemaps, or headless scraping with Playwright/Cheerio.

---

### 🧠 2. RAG Pipeline Integration (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Power AI-based applications like chatbots or search engines using locally stored `.md` content.
- Serve as a content layer for **LLMs like GPT**, enabling semantic search and summarization.

---

### 🧰 3. Developer CLI & REST API
- Add interactive CLI (`npx godspeed-crawl`) to trigger specific sync jobs.
- Provide API endpoints for external triggers, webhooks, or frontend dashboards.

---

### ⏱️ 4. Scheduled & Event-Driven Sync (with godspeed-cron)
- Integrate `godspeed-cron` to automate periodic syncs.
- Add file watchers or GitHub webhook support to trigger updates on change events.

---

### 🧪 5. Advanced File Diffing & Version Control
- Detect content changes via **SHA-256 hashing**, not just timestamps or commits.
- Maintain version history and rollback options for critical content sources.

---

### 🧑‍💻 6. Godspeed Studio Dashboard Integration
- Visualize sync activity, failures, and metadata using the Godspeed Studio UI.
- Track source health, sync intervals, and per-source analytics.

---

### 🔌 7. Plugin System for New Source Types
- Make architecture plugin-friendly to support:
  - 🧾 PDF/Doc file parsing
  - 🧵 Twitter/X thread archiving
  - 🗂️ Notion workspace sync
  - 🌍 Wikipedia or academic data crawling

---

### 🔐 8. Secure Multi-Repo Sync with Role-Based Access
- Enable syncing multiple private GitHub repos using user-specific tokens.
- Add granular access control and audit logging.

---

### 🔎 9. Search & Query Interface
- Enable full-text search or metadata queries on saved `.md` files.
- Useful for knowledge base apps or AI data pipelines.

---

### 💼 10. Real-World Use Cases
- Index GitHub issues & PRs for ML-based issue summarization
- Build a self-updating developer handbook
- Automatically sync open-source dependencies & monitor updates

---

> This project is not just a tool — it's a foundation for building intelligent, automated content platforms.


## 🔐 Security Note
This project uses `.env` for storing sensitive tokens.  
Make sure you **never commit your `.env` file**, and use `.gitignore` to exclude it.
